Change log:

Fixed blockchain rescanning. Clear unconfirmed transactions on rescan.

Better recipient account number validation. Do not accepts account
numbers that overflow or negative account numbers. Should prevent at
lest some cases of transactions being sent to wrong recipients due
to user error.
