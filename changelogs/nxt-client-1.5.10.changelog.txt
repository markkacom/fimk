Create installer package for Windows and Linux using the IzPack installer.
See https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issue/283

Added separate linux and windows (cygwin) build and release scripts.

Track and log database query execution times. The new properties:
nxt.statementLogThreshold, nxt.transactionLogThreshold, and
nxt.transactionLogInterval can be used to configure logging of slow queries.

Database performance improvements and optimizations. The account leasing data
has been moved from the account table to a separate account_lease table.
More table indexes have been added or existing ones modified.

Improved JSON encoding performance.

Outbound websockets connections are no longer initiated when using a socks or
http proxy (if system property socksProxyHost or http.proxyHost is defined).

Include expired prunable JSON in API transaction JSON, if available.

To protect public nodes from unneeded extra load, the getState API does not
include counts even if includeCounts=true, unless the adminPassword is either
provided as a parameter, or is not needed.

Added numberOfAccountLeases and numberOfActiveAccountLeases to getState,
showing the total number of scheduled (first lease only) or currently active
account balance leases.

Limit peer details length to 10 characters for version, 20 for application,
30 for platform, and 100 for announced address.


Client UI improvements:

Fixed a bug sometimes not showing notification badge after login.

Improved Bulgarian and Slovak translations.

Fix local signing of upload tagged data and approve transaction

This release will perform a full blockchain rescan on first start.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.11. If unpacking on top of existing installation,
delete the old lib folder first.
