This is an experimental release which adds the Prunable Messages feature. It
will be enabled at the same block as the Voting and Phasing features.

This is a required update for all testnet nodes, but is also possible to run
on main net.


New features:

Prunable plain and encrypted messages.

Plain and encrypted messages can now be created as prunable. For a prunable
message, the message data itself is never a part of the transaction bytes.
Instead, only a 32 byte sha256 hash of it is included in the bytes that are
being signed, used to verify the signature, or to generate the full
transaction hash or id. This makes it possible to completely remove the
message data at a later time, keeping only that 32 byte hash, and still be
able to verify the transaction signature and have the transaction hash and
id unaffected by the pruning.

Prunable messages have a predefined lifetime, after which their prunable parts
are deleted from the blockchain. This lifetime is measured starting from the
transaction timestamp of the message. When a node receives a transaction or
a block from a peer, it is only required that the prunable parts of any
prunable message are also included if their expiration time has not yet been
reached. If it has, and a valid message hash is included instead, the block or
transaction will still be accepted.

Currently the minimum lifetime of all prunable data is set to 24 h for testnet,
to allow easier testing of this feature. For main net, it is tentatively set
to two weeks, but this is subject to change before the stable release. Note
that pruning is performed at the same time as derived table trimming, which
by default is every 1000 blocks, so the actual removal of the prunable data
from the database will happen with some delay after their expiration time.

A node can choose to keep prunable messages longer, by setting the
nxt.maxPrunableLifetime property to a larger value. It cannot be set to
prune them earlier. Changing this value only affect transactions received
after the change. Pruning can be disabled completely by setting this property
to -1.

Prunable messages that have not yet been expired, but are past the minimum
lifetime, are only retrievable using the getPrunableMessage(s) APIs, but
are not included as part of their transaction JSON.

If a transaction containing prunable attachments is phased, the prunable
parts are nevertheless saved and available immediately, not at finish height.
If their expiration deadline comes before the phasing finish height, they
will be pruned and not available at finish height.

Fees for prunable message attachments are set at 0.1 NXT per 1024 bytes, with
the first 1024 bytes free (the regular transaction fee depending on its type
still applies). This is again subject to change before the stable release.

The full size of prunable message attachments is limited to 42 kbytes. Note
that the full size is still included for the purpose of calculating the total
block payload, even though only the 32 byte hash is in the transaction bytes.

The size of regular plain and encrypted messages in this release has been
restricted back to 1000 bytes, and will likely be reduced even further, before
the stable release. This will be done in order to encourage users to switch to
prunable instead of regular messages. Fees for regular message attachments
will also be increased substantially.

Creating prunable plain messages of less than 28 bytes is not allowed, as at
such small sizes it is more efficient to store the full message instead of a
32 byte hash of it. There is no lower limit on prunable encrypted messages.

It is not possible for a transaction to have both prunable plain and prunable
encrypted message at the same time. It is also not possible to have both
prunable and regular message of the same type (plain or encrypted). It is
however possible to have a regular plain message and an encrypted prunable
message, or a prunable plain message and a regular encrypted message.

Prunable encrypt-to-self messages are not currently supported as there seems to
be no good use case for them.

Prunable encrypted messages can optionally be compressed before the encryption
(default is to compress). The compression status is stored and does not need to
be specified when decrypting. Regular encrypted messages are still compressed
by default, but this compression can now optionally be disabled. For backwards
compatibility, since their current bytes format does not store the compression
status, this needs to be specified again when decrypting, else an error or
unreadable data will be returned.


New APIs:

GetPrunableMessage - returns the prunable message for a given transaction id,
optionally decrypting it if encrypted and if a secretPhrase is supplied.

GetPrunableMessages - returns all prunable messages for a given account id,
optionally limiting to only those with another account as recipient or sender,
and decrypting them if a secretPhrase is supplied.

Prunable messages that have already been pruned are not returned by the above
APIs.

The UI for those APIs will be implemented in a later release.

TrimDerivedTables - a debug API to trigger a derived tables trim, and prunable
tables pruning.


Changed APIs:

All APIs that create a new transaction now also accept optional
messageIsPrunable or encryptedMessageIsPrunable boolean parameters (default
false). If true, the message or encrypted message attachment, if any, is
created as a prunable message.

To control whether compression is performed before the encryption or not,
the new compressMessageToEncrypt and compressMessageToEncryptToSelf parameters
can be used (default true).

Prunable messages, if not yet pruned, are also returned as part of the
transaction json by the getAccountTransactions API, using the same fields as
the corresponding regular messages, but adding a messageIsPrunable or
encryptedMessageIsPrunable boolean flag.

ReadMessage now also handles prunable message attachments, if any. It takes
an optional uncompressDecryptedMessage and uncompressDecryptedMessageToSelf
(default true) parameters, only used for non-prunable messages (not needed
for prunable ones).

DecryptFrom accepts an optional uncompressDecryptedMessage parameter, and
encryptTo accepts an optional compressMessageToEncrypt parameter, default true.


INCOMPATIBLE changes:

BroadcastTransaction has been modified to optionally accept all parameters that
are needed to create a prunable plain or encrypted message (client side
encryption only). This is required because the data for such messages is never
a part of the transaction bytes themselves, so trying to broadcast a transaction
that has a prunable part by only submitting its bytes to broadcastTransaction
WILL FAIL, unless the corresponding parameters necessary to add the prunable
parts are also supplied. Note that they need to exactly match the original
parameters with which the transaction bytes have been created and signed.

For non-prunable messages, broadcastTransaction behaves as before, but users
are encouraged to start switching to prunable messages in view of the planned
size restrictions and fee increases.

The EncryptedData java class no longer handles compression internally, this is
left to the caller of the encrypt and decrypt methods to do.


Other changes:

GetPolls now supports an optional includeFinished parameter (default false).

Multiple bugfixes and improvements in the Voting System and Phasing UI.

The limit on transaction deadline of 1440 minutes has been removed. It is now
possible to create a transaction with a deadline of up to 32767 minutes. This
has been done because many use cases of phasing require that the transaction
bytes are prepared much earlier than the actual broadcasting of the transaction
to the blockchain.

This release will perform a database upgrade with a full rescan on first start.
On testnet, it will cause a rollback to block 256935.
