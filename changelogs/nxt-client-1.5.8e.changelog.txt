This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Set the content type to "text/plain; charset=UTF-8" when sending http requests
to peers. This is an important bug fix, as the incorrect encoding of outgoing blocks
and transactions containing some Unicode characters can prevent their propagation
and lead to forks. Everyone running the experimental release should update.
