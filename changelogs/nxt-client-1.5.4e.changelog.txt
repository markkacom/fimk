This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Fixed a bug in parsing ExtendTaggedData transaction json which prevents such
transactions from propagating between peers.

Added permanent message option to most send transaction dialogs.

Other minor bugfixes.
