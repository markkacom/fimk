I am uploading the fork release again so that those who want to form a fork are
not prevented from doing it.

Bugfixes. Prevent pulling blockchain from nodes not running this release, in order
to allow forging of a fork.


The changelog from 1.2.5b is repeated below:


This release disables all outgoing transactions from the BTER account:
10715382765594435905 after block height 209885.

If you use this release, existing blocks after that height will be deleted,
but the transactions in them preserved and reprocessed, except those originating
from the BTER account, and those with deadline already expired.

A rescan with validation will be performed automatically at start, it will take
longer and perform another rescan at the end.

This is an optional release. Forgers have a choice whether to use it, or stay
with the old 1.2.5 release, the community needs to decide whether to do the
rollback or stay with the old fork.
