Attachments are now stored in the database as byte arrays instead of serialized
objects. The conversion will take place at first start of this version and will
take some time and disk space, but after shutdown the database will shrink back
even more (about 25%).

Added blockchain checkpoint at NQT_BLOCK.

Rely on partially-canonical signatures being enforced after NQT_BLOCK to detect
signature malleability attacks, removed the logic enforcing uniqueness of
transaction hashes (excluding signatures). Only the fullHash (including
signature) is now unique. For this reason, the "hash" property has been removed
from the transaction JSON and only "fullHash" is returned now.

Use full hash instead of id for referenced transactions. Existing transactions
in the database will be reprocessed as part of the database conversion.

Referencing transactions can refer to transactions not more than 60 days back.
This limitation is enforced on the whole length of referenced transactions chain
in case the referenced transaction itself refers to a previous one and so on.
Also the length of such chains is limited to 10 transactions.

Removed some NotYetEnabled checks that are no longer relevant. Removed as much
as possible any obsolete logic that deals with NXT amounts, as all new
transactions will only be created in NQT format now.

More blacklisting of peers that cause RuntimeExceptions.

Trades returned by getTrades API are now in reversed order, most recent first.
