Added peer networking gzip compression. It is enabled by default, and will make
downloading of the blockchain faster, but in case it causes extra load on your
public node can be disabled by setting nxt.enablePeerServerGZIPFilter=false in
nxt.properties.

Enabled serving gzip compressed static resources (html, javascript, css files)
by the API Server. This would make loading the wallet UI from remote servers
faster. The compressed .gz files are included in the installation package.

Allow gzip compression of API Server responses too, however this is disabled
by default. This would be helpful when running the server on a remote machine,
for online wallets and service providers, to enable it set
nxt.enableAPIServerGZIPFilter=true in nxt.properties.

Fixed client-side rescanning bug that caused UI to appear outdated.
