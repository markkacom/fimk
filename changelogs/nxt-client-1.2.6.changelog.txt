Preserve unconfirmed transactions during rescan instead of relying on being
able to get them again from peers.

Keep retrying the block generation in the case it fails due to an invalid
transaction. Prevent block generation failures due to minimum transaction size
changes.

Ignore peer weights in choosing a random peer when hallmark protection is
disabled (it is enabled by default). When hallmark protection is enabled, the
nxt.maxNumberOfConnectedPublicPeers count is now based on hallmarked peers only,
i.e. the node will keep trying to connect to more peers until it is connected
to at least that many hallmarked peers.

Added peer networking addPeers request. After sending a getPeers request and
processing the response, the peer will also send to the other peer all peer
addresses it is connected to which are not present in the other peer's peers
set, to improve the propagation of peer addresses through the network.

Minor bugfixes.
