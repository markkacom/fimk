Aliases http API cleanup. There are only two API requests to get aliases now:

getAlias
parameters: either "aliasName" (the alias name) or "alias" (the alias id)
returns: full Alias JSON

getAliases
parameters: "timestamp" (optional timestamp) and "account" (the account id, 
required)
returns: list of aliases (full JSON) owned by the account, optionally filtered
by timestamp

The old getAliasId, getAliasIds, getAliasURI and listAccountAliases have been
removed as they are redundant and the new requests return all necessary info.

assignAlias has been renamed to setAlias, with "aliasName" and "aliasURI"
parameters.

Removed getAssetsByName API.

The getAssetsByIssuer API now accepts a multivalued "account" parameter and
returns a list of lists of assets issued by those accounts.

Use the slf4j logging framework. Thanks to ScripterRon for adapting our Logger
to use slf4j! The logging can now be configured in conf/logging.properties,
see conf/logging-default.properties for possible parameters and their defaults
and create a new conf/logging.properties file with any custom settings if
needed.

Minor DebugTrace improvements - log Arbitrary Messages events, sender and
recipient, and generated block ids.

Improvements in transaction validation and rescan logic.

Client updates:

No longer shows full list of assets. You must now add assets manually via
either the asset ID or account issuer ID.

Instant asset bookmark search (no enter needed).
