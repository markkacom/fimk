Improved display of blockchain downloading status in the client UI.

Added client translations, changed state from beta to stable for the following
languages: Italian, Dutch, Ukrainian.

Fixed a bug in transaction bytes parsing which could cause signature
verification failed errors and break forging.

When downloading the blockchain, require at most one fork confirmation when
still below the last hardcoded checkpoint (currently MS block).

New API calls for peer management: addPeer and blacklistPeer. AddPeer will add
a peer address or IP, optionally with port number, to the list of known peers
and will try to connect to it. BlacklistPeer (password protected) will
blacklist a peer, for the default blacklisting period.

These APIs, and a few others related to peer networking, have been grouped under
a new Networking tab on the /test page.

Peer port handling has been improved to allow different peers to share the same
IP address provided they use different ports.

To prevent overloading a node with invalid peer addresses, the maximum total
number of known peers is limited to nxt.maxNumberOfKnownPeers (default 2000).
Once this number has been reached, new peer addresses are not added, and peers
that have been last connected to more than a week ago are removed from the known
peer list, provided the node has enough connected public peers, until the number
of known peers is again reduced to below nxt.minNumberOfKnownPeers (default
1000).

Improved database performance by storing currency supply and reserve per unit
data in a separate table.

This release will perform a rescan on first start.

Updated jetty to version 9.2.7. If unpacking on top of a previous installation,
delete your lib directory first to remove the old jetty libraries.
