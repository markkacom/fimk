This is the experimental release to test the new Monetary System major feature.
It is enabled on testnet, and those running testnet nodes should upgrade to this
release, even if they don't plan to use the MS features, otherwise will be left
on a fork. This release is also possible to run on main net, but is not to be
considered stable for production use there. The Monetary System block is not yet
defined for main net.


New features:

Monetary System.
See https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issue/205/monetary-system-documentation
for a detailed description.
See https://bitbucket.org/JeanLucPicard/nxt/issue/207/mint-worker-utility for a
description of the MintWorker tool for currency minting.

Dividend payment transaction. Asset issuers can make a dividend payment to all
asset holders with a single transaction. Required parameters are the blockchain
height at which asset holders shares will be counted (must be less than 1440
blocks in the past), and the amount to be paid per share.

Delete alias transaction. The owner of an alias can now delete it completely,
thus making the alias available for anyone to reserve again if desired.

Message pattern in AccountInfo. An account owner can set a regular expression
pattern in the AccountInfo for his account, using the setAccountInfo API.
Once such a pattern has been set, incoming transactions to this account are only
accepted if they contain a plain text message which matches this pattern. The
syntax follows the java.util.regex.Pattern specification.


API changes:

After MS block, adding a public key announcement when sending a transaction to
an account without a public key will be optional.

Added withMessage boolean parameter to getAccountTransactions and 
getAccountTransactionIds APIs, to return only transactions having a message
attachment, either non-encrypted or decryptable by the account.

Added optional includeLessors, includeAssets, and includeCurrencies boolean
parameters to getAccount API. Set to false when retrieving those data is not
needed, in order to improve the getAccount performance.

After MS block, sending messages, selling aliases, and leasing balances, to the
Genesis account, will be disallowed.

The popOff debug API now allows pop off of more than max rollback number of
blocks, triggering a full rescan in such case.


Internal changes:

After the Monetary System block, the order in which transactions in a block are
executed will be determined by the block forger, instead of by id, default being
by arrival time at the forger's node.

Improvements in blockchain download to prevent getting stuck on the wrong fork.
Nodes will download blocks in batches of not more than 719 blocks at a time
from a single peer, and after each such batch will verify  with
nxt.numberOfForkConfirmations other peers (default 5) if this is the best
fork, before continuing, unless the downloaded batch is of less than 10 blocks.

Rescan status is now saved in the database, to prevent the database from being
left in an inconsistent state when a rescan fails or is interrupted. Once a
rescan has been scheduled, it will be triggered again at restart, until it
completes successfully.

Improvements in the processing of unconfirmed transactions.

This release will perform a rescan on first start.
