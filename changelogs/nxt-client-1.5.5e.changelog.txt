This is an experimental release. It is a required update for all testnet nodes,
but is also possible to run on main net.

Fixed processing of unconfirmed ExtendTaggedData transactions.

AddPeer and BlacklistPeer APIs now require POST and admin password.

This release will perform a full rescan on testnet.
