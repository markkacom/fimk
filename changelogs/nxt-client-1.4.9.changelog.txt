Server Logic
============
Password protect the Debug APIs. The nxt.enableDebugAPI property is no longer
used. Instead, the debug APIs which allow direct manipulation of the blockchain
database are always enabled, but are now protected with a password, which needs
to be set in the nxt.adminPassword property. Password is not required when the
API server is listening on the localhost interface only (the default).
The password protection can be disabled by setting nxt.disableAdminPassword=true.

Some refactoring to allow creation and signing of transactions using the Java API
even in the complete absence of blockchain data, as needed for the MintWorker.

Minor peer networking improvement, addPeers and processBlock requests are now
executed in the background.

Improvements in fork resolution. The peer networking getNextBlocks API no longer
limits the number of blocks returned to 1 MB total payload size, but always
returns 720 blocks, if available.


MintWorker
==========
Added nxt.mint.stopOnError property, default false. Minting will now continue,
by default, even after an error occurred when sending the mint transaction to 
the server.

Minting transactions are now signed locally and sent to the server using the
broadcastTransaction API. Thus the secretPhrase for the minting account is never
sent to the server, and the server or the connection to it do not need to be
trusted. The secretPhrase is also not logged to the log output anymore.


User Interface
==============
Added second row of info boxes on Dashboard.

Notifications for incoming messages.

Reworked page navigation.

Account leasing dialog now displays the number of blocks until lease expiration.

Fixed named account links on the transaction info dialog.

Client Translation
