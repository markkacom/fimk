This is still a test release intended to get testnet working. Please update
your testnet nodes.

Bugfixes in transaction attachment versioning and version validation.

Added encrypt-to-self message attachment type. Any transaction can optionally
have such an attachment, intended to be used for private notes that only the
transaction sender can read. This feature is not yet supported by the GUI.

Added nxt.isOffline property. If set to true in nxt.properties, peer networking
will not start, no peers will be loaded from the database, and no outgoing
connections will be made.
