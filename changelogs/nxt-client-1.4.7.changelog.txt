This is a mandatory update. Everyone should update to 1.4.7 or later before
block 330000.

The Message Pattern in AccountInfo feature, introduced in 1.4.0e, has been
disabled, and will not be activated at block 330000. This is to prevent
possible denial of service attacks by malicious regular expression patterns
which can cause excessive CPU load with certain inputs. This feature will
probably be introduced again in 1.5, but with a predefined set of allowed
well behaved regex patterns.

Multiple minor UI improvements and bugfixes.

Enhanced nxt.allowedBotHosts property to also accepts a range of addresses
using CIDR notation.

This release will perform a rescan on first start, on testnet only.
