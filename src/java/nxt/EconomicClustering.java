/**
 * Economic Clustering concept (EC) solves the most critical flaw of "classical" Proof-of-Stake - the problem called
 * "Nothing-at-Stake".
 *
 * I ought to respect BCNext's wish and say that this concept is inspired by Economic Majority idea of Meni Rosenfeld
 * (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Meni_Rosenfeld).
 *
 * EC is a vital part of Transparent Forging. Words "Mining in Nxt relies on cooperation of people and even forces it"
 * (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=553205.0) were said about EC.
 *
 * Keep in mind that this concept has not been peer reviewed. You are very welcome to do it...
