FIMK 0.3 is based on NXT 1.2.6.

All users MUST update to this version before block 203000 or you will
end up on a fork.

                          == Core ==

* Upgraded to NXT 1.2.6

* Digital Goods Store

* PKA (Public Key Announcement) block has passed

* Added the nxt.allowedToForge property to nxt-default.properties, value can be
  empty which does not allow anyone to forge, a * to allow everyone or a ; 
  delimited list of account numbers (either old or RS format)

* Alias transfer

* ... please see NXT 1.2.6 changelogs for all features

* Namespaced Aliases

  FIMK Namespaced Aliases are scoped per account. 
  This means you can use any alias you wish, even the same ones that someone 
  else is using.
  Namespaced Alias makes the blockchain more suitable for storing small pieces 
  of data in decentralized storage.
  The aliases you register are stored either in plain text or encrypted and 
  can thus be read by anyone or only be read through access to your account, 
  or access details that you grant to a third party (setting a Namespaced 
  Alias costs 0.1 FIM)

                    == FIM Community Client ==

Development of FIM Community Client has stopped as it has been rebranded into 
mofo wallet.

                         == Mofo Wallet ==

Client development for FIMK continues in the mofo wallet project. Not all 
functionality has been ported to mofo wallet so for the time being we'll
continue shipping the old default NXT client.

When all functionality of the default client has been ported to mofo wallet
it will be shipped together with FIMK server releases (like this one).
