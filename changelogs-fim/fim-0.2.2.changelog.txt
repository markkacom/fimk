FIMK 0.2.2 is based on NXT 1.1.5.

* Fixed a bug where you could not register an account aliases. Now you can use 
  both numeric and RS (Reed Solomon FIM-***) accounts to register account
  aliases.

* Fixed some unclear/confusing warning messages related to sending high amounts

* Enabled auto update mechanism. Downloads are on github which are verified
  by the client using a SHA256 hash stored in the blockchain.
  Users of an outdated version will receive a notification in the client.

* Allow using comma as decimal separator. You can use a comma or dot in any 
  amount or fee field.
  
* Introduced a forging countdown indicator. 
  The indicator is located next to your forging balance and tells the average 
  expected time before you can forge the next block. Because of the changing 
  state of the network/blockchain FIM cannot determine exactly when you'll 
  create the next block. Click the button next to the countdown indicator to 
  refresh forging. 
  When you refresh forging you'll ask FIM to recalculate your forging deadline,
  this deadline will be based on the most recent network/blockchain state.
  Refreshing forging does not influence your chance to find a block faster or 
  slower.
