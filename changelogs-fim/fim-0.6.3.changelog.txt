Bug fix. Accounts that contain ask or bid orders from before the most recent
fork did not return correct results from getActivity API, this resulted in empty
activity lists in the client.

For users who do not access the getActivity API (either directly or through the
client) this update is not strictly necessary.

                          ~~~ UPDATE ~~~

The instruction displayed in the logs to update will be something like this:

    sh update_fimk.sh 0.6.3 [insert 64 character sha hash here]

To get around the missing update_fimk.sh file you instead must issue the 
following extra command to update to this version, in future versions this extra 
step is not needed since the build system now includes that script.

So to update to this release instead do this:

    curl -L -k -o update_fimk.sh https://git.io/vzhl9
    sh update_fimk.sh 0.6.3 [insert 64 character sha hash here]

If you would first like to inspect the shell script before executing it simply
open https://git.io/vzhl9 in your browser.
