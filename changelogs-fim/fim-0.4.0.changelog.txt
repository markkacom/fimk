This is the FIMK server package, while you can run this on your computer it's
not intended as such. Users of the FIMK server package generally install it 
on a server.

For people looking for the installable FIMK client please check out our 
desktop client dubbed MofoWallet which can be found at our github repo which 
is here https://github.com/fimkrypto/mofowallet/releases.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

FIMK 0.4.0 is based on NXT 1.4.13 (plus the critical parts of 1.4.16)

This is a hard fork everyone MUST update to this release. The hard fork will go 
into effect the moment we set an alias that enables new accounts without public
key to receive FIMK.

On first startup a series of changes will be performed on the database, these 
changes are quite extensive and might take a while to complete. Just let it run
and FIMK will start when it's ready.

* Fixed the recent forking issues

* Upgraded to NXT 1.4.13/16 (most recent NXT release)
  
  Tons of upstream (NXT) security updates and general improvements.
  
  - Improvements in exception handling, transaction validation, error logging.
  - Prevent server from starting if any of the startup tasks failed.
  - Avoid unnecessary DNS queries.
  - No longer process or return "comment" parameters in Asset Transfer.
  - Stores all derived objects in the database, instead of keeping all of them 
    in memory only.
  - Startup time is now reduced to a few seconds only.
  - Everywhere, object ids that used to be Longs are now primitive longs.
  - Preserve and re-process unconfirmed transactions after fork resolution 
    pop-off.
  - Improved propagation of unconfirmed transactions.
  - Multiple minor improvements and optimizations based on profiling results.
  - Updated to latest Jetty version
  - Allow re-broadcasting of transactions already in the unconfirmed pool.
  - Show correct timestamps in asset transfer history.
  - Only try to set account public key when inside a database transaction,
    fixes a bug in setting public keys for accounts that never had an
    outgoing transaction.
  - Improved default H2 cache size allocation.
  - Disabled the SSLv3 protocol when using SSL for the API.
  - Fixed incorrect guaranteed balance bug in getAccountLessors API.
  - Cache hallmarked peer account balances to reduce number of database calls.
  - Other minor performance improvements and bugfixes.
  - Fixed decryption of purchased DGS goods.
  - Fixed missing DGS purchase feedbacks.
  - Implemented full text search using the Lucene library, as supported by H2.
  - Show purchase counts and public feedback counts in all API responses 
    returning Goods JSON, unless includeCounts parameter is false.
  - Increased default purchase delivery deadline to 168 hours (1 week).
  - Include full peer info in getPeers API if includePeerInfo=true, to avoid 
    having to do a separate getPeer request for each peer.
  - Allow transaction signing in signTransaction to skip the validation of the
    transaction bytes being signed, if an optional validate=false parameter is 
    added.
  - Allow sending messages with no recipient.
  - Automatically blacklist peers with version older than 0.3.3
  - After the Monetary System block, the order in which transactions in a block 
    are executed will be determined by the block forger, instead of by id, 
    default being by arrival time at the forger's node.
  - Improvements in blockchain download to prevent getting stuck on the wrong 
    fork.
  - Nodes will download blocks in batches of not more than 719 blocks at a time
    from a single peer, and after each such batch will verify  with
    nxt.numberOfForkConfirmations other peers (default 5) if this is the best
    fork, before continuing, unless the downloaded batch is of less than 10 
    blocks.
  - Rescan status is now saved in the database, to prevent the database from 
    being left in an inconsistent state when a rescan fails or is interrupted. 
    Once a rescan has been scheduled, it will be triggered again at restart, 
    until it completes successfully.
  - Improvements in the processing of unconfirmed transactions.
  - Fixed currency decimals issue.
  - Fixed minor bugs in MS transaction validation.
  - Additional validations of Monetary System transactions, and bugfixes
    in existing validations.
  - Bugfixes in currency minting and in MintWorker.
  - Improved peer networking to run the sending of blocks and transactions
    to peers in a background thread.
  - Do not log currency exchanges of zero amount.
  - Fixed setting of peer state. Improvements in connecting to peers.
  - Enforce that currency exchange offer expiration height is after the current
    blockchain height.
  - The Message Pattern in AccountInfo feature, introduced in 1.4.0e, has been
    disabled, and will not be activated. This is to prevent
    possible denial of service attacks by malicious regular expression patterns
    which can cause excessive CPU load with certain inputs.
  - Enhanced nxt.allowedBotHosts property to also accepts a range of addresses
    using CIDR notation.
  - Allow no more than one unconfirmed minting transaction per account and minted
    currency to be accepted in the unconfirmed pool.
  - Better validation of hallmarks for peers with multiple addresses. Do not
    blacklist peers with invalid hallmarks but just treat them as not hallmarked.
  - Minor peer networking improvement, addPeers and processBlock requests are now
    executed in the background.
  - Improvements in fork resolution. The peer networking getNextBlocks API no 
    longer limits the number of blocks returned to 1 MB total payload size, 
    but always returns 720 blocks, if available.
  - Fixed a bug in transaction bytes parsing which could cause signature
    verification failed errors and break forging.
  - When downloading the blockchain, require at most one fork confirmation when
    still below the last hardcoded checkpoint.
  - Peer port handling has been improved to allow different peers to share the 
    same IP address provided they use different ports.
  - To prevent overloading a node with invalid peer addresses, the maximum total
    number of known peers is limited to nxt.maxNumberOfKnownPeers (default 2000).
    Once this number has been reached, new peer addresses are not added, and peers
    that have been last connected to more than a week ago are removed from the known
    peer list, provided the node has enough connected public peers, until the number
    of known peers is again reduced to below nxt.minNumberOfKnownPeers (default
    1000).
  - Improved database performance by storing currency supply and reserve per unit
    data in a separate table.
  - Fixed a bug in transaction validation that could break blockchain downloading.
  - The default (and minimum allowed) value for nxt.maxRollback is now 1441.
  - Restrict maximum HTTP request and response size in peer networking to prevent
    potential out of memory attacks.
  - Improved fork resolution by allowing a better difficulty block pushed from a
    peer to replace the current last block.
  - When forging, do not accept a peer block with hit time after the next hit time
    of a currently forging account (i.e. prevent front-running in forging).
  - Removed the possibility of a forger to miss his turn. Even if late, the block
    will still be generated and submitted.
  - Delay forging and submission of blocks by 20 s, configurable via the
    nxt.forgingDelay property, in order to be able to accumulate more transactions
    in the forged block. The arrival of a front-running block from a peer however
    cancels that delay and the next block is generated up to 3 s earlier instead,
    which can be controlled via the nxt.forgingSpeedup property.
  - Better logging of peer networking errors. Log, but do not blacklist missing or
    malformed JSON responses.
  - Database optimization. Moved the public key of accounts, transaction senders,
    and block forgers to a separate table, resulting in 15% reduction of total
    database size.
  - Enforce that the nxt-default.properties file used matches the version of the
    current release.
  - Peer networking improvements, better logging, bugfixes.

* The NXT client (known as wesley client) has been removed from the FIMK server 
  package. A slimmed down single currency (without NXT support) version of
  the FIMK client (aka MofoWallet) has replaced it.
  
  If people want the old client back they can copy it back from the FIMK 0.3.3 
  release. You should copy the entire `html` folder from 0.3.3 and move it to 
  FIMK 0.4.0. Then in nxt.properties set `nxt.apiResourceBase=html/ui`.
  
  We will no longer do work on the old client.
  
* FIMK now has an embedded WebSocket server, it's separate from the existing
  API server. 
  
  The WebSocket protocol is an improvement of the more than 25 year
  old HTTP protocol. WebSockets are faster, more efficient and allow for 
  two-way communication.
  
  See these posts for background information:
  
  http://fimkchat.com/2015/03/connecting-to-fimk-websockets/
  http://fimkchat.com/2015/03/fimk-adds-websocket-support-to-its-core/
  
* New functionality for FIMK is now exposed as asynchronous RPC calls accessed 
  over the WebSocket server.
  
  Because of the two-way communication abilities of WebSockets now RPC calls 
  can be created that do work in a background thread on the server and will 
  notify the client when they are ready. Meanwhile the server and client can 
  be used as normal.

* The old API server is turned off by default. If you need to access it you can
  enable it in nxt.properties through `nxt.enableAPIServer=true`
  
* A bridge exists in the callFunction RPC to call any old API method by name,
  the old API calls are accessed from memory so no need to actually run/start
  the API server (saves memory/cpu).
  
* Tons of new RPC calls, each one tailored to support a different aspect of the
  FIMK client (aka MofoWallet).
  
  List of new RPC calls (WebSocket API).
  
  - CallAPIFunction  
    Call any old API calls in the old HTTP API server. We support each call 
    listed here http://wiki.nxtcrypto.org/wiki/Nxt_API. It is not necessary
    for the API server to be running.    
  
  - GetAccount  
    Returns the account balance, name and some other account related things. 
  
  - GetAccountAssets  
    Allows to paginate through list of account owned assets. Asset data always 
    includes the asset name, decimal places etc for easy access on the client.
    Pagination is index based. 
  
  - GetAccountCurrencies  
    Allows pagination through all currencies owned by an account, currency 
    details are always included.
    Pagination is index based.
  
  - GetAccountPosts  
    Allows to paginate through all POSTS written by an account. 
    POSTS are stored in the mofo_post database table.
    Pagination is index based.
    
  - GetAssetPosts  
    Same as account posts but works for asset posts
    
  - GetComments  
    Allows to paginate over comments for account and asset posts.
    Pagination is index based.
    
  - GetCommentCount  
    Returns the number of comments for a post.
  
  - GetAccounts  
    Returns balances for multiple accounts
  
  - GetActivity  
    Returns blocks, transactions and trades. This extensive RPC call can be used
    to return all trades + transactions spanning a selection of blocks. Supports
    a filter mechanism to query for transactions based on time and on a range
    of transaction types.
  
  - GetActivityStatistics  
    Returns network statistics, average block time, block rewards per day, week 
    month.
    
  - GetAskOrder, GetBidOrder  
    Returns an ask/bid order.
    
  - GetAsset  
    Does what it says
    
  - GetAssetChartData  
    There is a listener that listens trades in blocks. The asset prices are 
    bundled per hour, 3 hour, day and week to get a moving average and open, 
    close, high, low and average prices. 
    These moving averages (and open/close etc) are stored in a new table in the
    database and this RPC accesses that data.
  
  - GetAssetOrders, GetAssetTrades  
    Does what it says. Pagination is index based.
    
  - GetBlockchainState  
    Minimalist blockchain state includes only height and timestamp.
    
  - GetForgingStats
    Allows paginating over the list of top forgers for the past 24 hours.
    Pagination is timestamp based.
    
  - GetMyOpenOrders
    Allows paginating over all open orders but for a list of accounts.
    Pagination is index based.
  
  - GetRecentTransactions
    Returns recent transactions (includes unconfirmed) for a list of accounts.
    Supports the same filter mechanism as GetActivity RPC.
    Pagination is index based.

* New feature.. Write POSTS/BLOGS linked to an Account or Asset. The POSTS are
  stored on the blockchain (for now) and are entered through AM (arbitrary 
  messages). The AM format was chosen instead of a new transaction type in 
  order to stay compatible with NXT and allow the functionality to be used in 
  multi-currency MofoWallet client.
  
  The POSTS are stored in the database and are fully aware of blockchain reorgs.
  
  Note: POSTS are limited to accounts and assets but will be extended to 
  currencies and goods on the goods store.  
  
* New feature.. Write COMMENTS to POSTS/BLOGS every account can leave a comment
  on each Asset or Account POST.
  
* Added tests for most new functionality

* Upcoming big feature PRIVATE ASSETS. This is partially coded in this release
  also tests have been created. Expected for an upcoming hard fork. Allows for
  strong control over orders and participants and to set different order fee
  and trade fee which will be paid to the ASSET ISSUER.
