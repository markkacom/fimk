Fixes a bug where fresh blockchain downloads could not verify one or more
block generation signatures.

Fixes a bug where pre-private-asset-fork asset issuance transactions where 
incorrectly read while uploading blocks to blockchain downloaders.

Introduces some new and extends some existing HTTP API's for use in new 
Lompsa client 2.0. These API's are likely to change in the future.

- getTransactionCount
- getAccountTransactionCount
- getBlockchainTransactions

Introduces new websocket push event mechanism for use in Lompsa 2.0, through
this new mechanism clients can register/unregister for detailed server side
push events. Lompsa 2.0 new codebase and extension mechanism are tightly 
coupled with this event mechanism.

Adds column sort functionality to getNamespacedAlias API, this is also available 
in the bundled client.

Includes a fix for incorrect namespaced alias handling, this fix requires a 
hard fork of the network which will be enabled through the setting of another
hard fork alias (this functionality was introduced a few releases ago).

Before we enable the hard fork we would like to see a considerable amount of 
nodes to have updated.
