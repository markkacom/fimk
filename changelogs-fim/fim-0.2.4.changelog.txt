FIMK 0.2.4 is based on NXT 1.1.6.

This release will run on test-net only. To prevent any bugs in this version 
from messing up the main-net, the nxt.isTestNet property will not work.
Test net is enabled at the source code level. 

* Upgrade to use NXT 1.1.6

* Account Lease is enabled in the server and the UI
