NXT 1.4.17 upstream changes:
  This is a critical bugfix release. Everyone is required to update.
  Fixed validation of asset exchange order cancellations.
  Fixed excessive memory usage in unconfirmed transaction processing.

FIMK 0.4.2 changes:

  - Removed the lucene index on the account name and account description 
    tables. this temporarily removes the search by account name functionality
    but i expect to re-introduce that in a future release.
    This change will dramatically increase the speed with wihch blocks can 
    be processed while downloading.

  - Removed the alias dependency for the public key hard fork change.
    From now on not requiring the public key is hardcoded in the source code.

  - Redone the build system that integrates and tunes mofowallet for use in
    FIMK server. This is not immediately visible to end users.
