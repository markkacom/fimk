FIMK 0.2.1 is based on NXT 1.1.5.

Some bug fixes in the html client.

* Renamed some occurences of NXT where it should say FIM
* Fixed a bug where you cannot create an account alias. In this release you can 
  create an account alias using a numeric account. This will be fixed in a next
  release it will be possible to create account aliases with Reed Solomon 
  addresses to.
