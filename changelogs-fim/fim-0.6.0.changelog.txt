FIMK 0.6.0 is a mandatory update, you must update to this version before:

                    Jan 18th 2016 - 21.00 GMT

This is a critical update and will cause you to be on a fork if you don't
update. The hard fork will happen by setting a set of pre-determined aliases
on the FIMK blockchain.  

FIMK 0.6.0 is based on NXT 1.5.10
  
  NXT 1.5.10 is the last NXT release before enabling the following 
  functionalities:
    
  - Monetary System
  - Voting
  - Phasing
  - Prunable Message Data
    
  At this stage while this code is ready and available on the FIMK testnet we
  did not yet decide to enable these functionalities on the main FIMK net.
  Instead this release enables only new FIMK functionalities.
    
FIMK 0.6.0 changes:

This release embeds Lompsa client 0.5.0.

Private Assets 
  
  When issueing an asset users can choose to issue a 'private' asset instead
  of a 'standard' asset. This functionality is implemented through a change 
  to the internal asset exchange mechanism where we've introduced the 'type'
  property for each asset. Currently there are the types 'standard' and 
  'private', in the future more asset types can be added through this 
  mechanism.
  
  A private asset is meant for use in financial institutions, it is an asset
  class which gives the asset issuer more control over the asset on the
  decentralized FIMK network.
  
  Issueing a private asset costs 10,000 FIM.
  
  A private asset issuer can do the following:
  
  1. Issue a new asset and mark it private
  
     To create a private asset either use the Lompsa client and tick the 
     'private' checkbox when issueing a new asset.
     Or use the HTTP API "issueAsset" and provide a "type" parameter which 
     is set to "1" for private assets. ("0" is the default but can be 
     omitted for standard assets). 
  
  2. Determine (to) who the asset can be traded or transfered.
     
     Accounts are either allowed or not allowed to trade and transfer, the
     asset issuer can add and remove these accounts.
     Buy or sell orders from accounts that are removed from the list of 
     accounts allowed to trade or transfer are automatically cancelled.
  
     Adding an account to the list of allowed accounts costs 10 FIM,
     removing an account from the list of allowed accounts costs 0.1 FIM.
     
     To add (or remove) allowed accounts either use the Lompsa client (see
     Lompsa Advanced section).
     Or use the HTTP API "addPrivateAssetAccount" or 
     "removePrivateAssetAccount", provide the asset identifier as the 'asset'
     parameter and set the account to add/remove as the transaction 
     recipient. 
  
  3. Set and collect trade fee
  
     Asset issuer can (optionally) set a trade fee for the private asset. 
     Upon each automated trade which occurs in the decentralized order 
     matching engine a percentage is taken from the receiving account, this
     is either FIM (or colored FIM) or the private asset being traded.
     
     Changing the trade fee costs 0.1 FIM, default trade fee is set to 0%.
     
  4. Set and collect order fee
  
     Asset issuer can (optionally) set a order fee for private assets. When
     selling an asset the order fee is paid as a percentage of the amount of
     assets offered, when buying an asset the order fee fee is paid as a 
     percentage of the total amount of FIMK (or colored FIMK) offered.
     
     Changing the order fee costs 0.1 FIM, default order fee is set to 0%.

     To change the order or trade fee percentage either use the Lompsa 
     client (see Lompsa Advanced section).
     Or use the HTTP API "setPrivateAssetFee" this API call allows to set  
     both order and trade fee with a single call. The call expects the 
     "asset" parameter to identify the asset and a percentage value for 
     either (or both) "orderFeePercentage" and "tradeFeePercentage".
     
     See the following table for what values relate to which percentages.
     
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     | Parameter (**FeePercentage)              | Actual percentage        | 
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     | 1                                        | 0.000001%                | 
     | 10                                       | 0.00001%                 | 
     | 100,000                                  | 0.1%                     | 
     | 1,000,000                                | 1%                       | 
     | 10,000,000                               | 10%                      |
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
     
     When using the Lompsa client UI these values are calculated and 
     formatted automatically for you.         
     
Colored Accounts

  Colored accounts is a new FIMK feature which borrows it's name from the 
  concept of colored-coins.
  With colored accounts any user can create their own account color and create
  one or more initial colored accounts.
  
  This is similar in many ways to the Monetary System but with some key 
  differences:
  
  1. You must send FIM to a colored account to turn it into colored FIM (no need
     for large amounts - works just as well with NQT (0.00000001 FIM)).
  
  2. Colored accounts are not limited in functionality as Monetary System units
     are; colored accounts can be used in the Asset Exchange as well as in the
     Marketplace and all other current and future FIMK functionalities.
     
  3. Colored accounts are supported in the Lompsa client as regular accounts.
  
  4. FIM can be transfered to colored FIM and back to FIM again by sending it 
     to the color creator.
  
  Once the color creator has created the account color and the initial colored
  account is assigned you can create any new number of colored accounts simply 
  by sending them a payment, asset transfer or message. Only new accounts can 
  become colored accounts.

  Creating a new account color costs 10,000 FIM.
  
  To create a new account color either use the Lompsa client (see advanced 
  section).
  Or use the HTTP API "accountColorCreate" which expects a 'name' and 
  'description' parameter.
  
  To assign the initial colored account either use the Lompsa client (see
  advanced section).
  Or use the HTTP API "accountColorAssign" which expects an "accountColorId" and
  the "recipient".
  
Email Account Identifiers

  The preparation for this feature is still under way, this release enables the
  core requirements to move to this new method of identifying accounts.
