This is the FIMK server package, while you can run this on your computer it's
not intended as such. Users of the FIMK server package generally install it 
on a server.

For people looking for the installable FIMK client please check out our 
desktop client dubbed MofoWallet which can be found at our github repo which 
is here https://github.com/fimkrypto/mofowallet/releases.
