About the hard fork:

  On Friday December 19th 2014 we were informed of a theft of 57 Million FIMK 
  from a user's account by a hacker, who gained gained access to the accounts 
  through the user carelessly sending his account passphrases to a rigged public 
  node. The hacker transferred a total of approx. 57 Million FIMK from several 
  accounts to 59 other accounts, each account receiving roughly 1M FIMK. 
  In total this amounts to 13.9 % of all FIMK in existence at this time.
  
  As the portion of stolen funds is a significant portion of the total FIMK in 
  circulation, the association is obliged to intervene. To avoid a situation 
  where FIMK would at the mercy of a thief in possession of a large portion of 
  total funds, strengthening her stake by forging constantly and thus gaining 
  undue control of the network, AND likely dumping some of the large stash 
  constantly rendering the remaining FIMK worthless (as has happened before with 
  other coins in similar large scale incidents) the association decided to freeze 
  the hacker assets by releasing customized emergency version of the FIMKrypto 
  server which does just that. 
  
  This release temporarily seals the stolen FIMK in the protocol making them 
  untouchable by no one, not even by the association. This is done to prevent 
  mixing of the stolen funds through further transfers to obfuscate the origin, 
  which we were able to prevent just in time. The following steps and measures 
  to be taken for the frozen stash are discussed with the community and decided 
  on the basis of those discussions.

Mandatory update

  Earlier server releases (before 0.3.3) are blacklisted by default to prevent 
  the chance of future forks and keep the network coherent.
  
Hacker accounts locked

  There are 59 accounts identified that hold the stolen FIMK, the public keys to
  these accounts are locked from making outgoing transactions and are not allowed
  to forge blocks.
